# Modifying a website for a Marketing Agency

## Description 

The project involved modifying a stater code for a website. The project is about taking an existing code and refactoring it for a marketing company in order to make it more accessible.  The purpose of the project is to make the website more accessible for people with disabilities so as for them to be able to assess the website using accessible technologies such as screen readers and braille. 
Accessible websites are also better positioned in search engines such as Google therefore improving their business. It also helps websites avoid lawsuits which can happen if people with disabilities cannot access their website. 
The code has also been tidied up to make it easier to read which will make it easier for future maintenance.

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.
